# Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

# Take two numbers as input from the user
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Perform operations
addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2
multiplication = num1 * num2
division = num1 / num2


# Display results
print("\nResults of Basic Mathematical Operations:")
print( 'Addition :', addition)
print('Subtraction:',subtraction)
print('Multiplication:',multiplication)
print('Division:',division)
